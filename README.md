# SPTarkov_PassiveHeals

SPT version: 3.9.8


Allows passive healing.


Install the .dll and insert into BepInEx/plugins/


Can be configed (F12 in game) to specify the amount of healing, the timer between heals, and whether to heal all body parts (or just the lowest).


Designed to be used with SPTRealism to simulate the "natural" healing of the human body.


Note: there is no ingame indicator for the healing passive, your limb health will magically go back.
